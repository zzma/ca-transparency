# CA Transparency 

This repository contains the data and code used for measuring/analyzing the operational
features of CAs in the modern web PKI as of July 1, 2020. Please see the

- `data/fides\_clusters\_20200701.psv`: Pipe ("|") separated fields for Fides clusters
- `data/fides\_edges\_20200701.psv`: Pipe ("|") separated fields for Fides cluster edges
- `data/cert\_fps`: certificate fingerprints generated by different issuers
- `data/cert\_network\_infrastructure`: network infrastructure utilized by
  different issuers
- `data/fides\_cluster\_ccadb\_owner\_resolved.psv`: manual resolution of SSPKIs with conflicting CCADB labels
- `data/fides\_sspki\_ccadb\_owner\_resolved.psv`: manual resolution of Fides clusters with conflicting CCADB labels
